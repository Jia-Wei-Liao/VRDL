# CUB_200_2011_Dataset_Classification
In this homework, we implement the deep learning method to classify the birds images.
To avoid over-fitting, we use many augmentation to increase our training data. Then
we train the model with five fold cross validation. For the test time, we collect the
prediction which generate by five fold model and voting them.

## Environment
- `numpy == 1.18.5`
- `torch == 1.8.1 + cu101`
- `torchvision == 0.9.1 + cu101`

## Training
Open the `main01_training.py` and modify `params.file_root` by your file root.
- If you want to change the model, please set `params.model` to the `resnet50`, `resnet101`, `resnext50` or `resnext101`.
- If you want to do the k-fold cross validation, please set `params.K_fold == True`.


## Evaluation (reproducing submission)
There are two step that you need to notice.  

**Step 1.**
Download the all pretrain model on the
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Lt3mBJ0sucQNb-WwA1Llq-XLHWpjfVn?usp=sharing.
Then put the folder on the correct place.


**Step 2.** 
Open the `main02_ensemble.py` and modify `params.file_root` by your file root.
- You can adjust the checkpoint on the `ModelList` according to your requirement. 
- If you suffer from Out-Of-Memory errors, please reduce `params.batch_size`.
